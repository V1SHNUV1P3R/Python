    "### <u>Where do data scientists get their data?</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "A data scientist needs sources for data to do his or her work. While you don't need this level of detail on the AP test, here are is some information about the types of data available to data scientists:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Unstructured data:** Most data available on the web is unstructured data. Image files, sound files, video files, text files, and HTML files are all examples of unstructured data. These are some of the richest sources of data available, but they are also difficult to process (search, sort, classify, analyze, summarize etc). For example, while you were easily able to write algorithms in a previous chapter to apply image filters to the pixels of an image, it is very difficult to write functions to classify the objects featured in image files (people, trees, dogs, cats, mountains, etc). Similarly, while a web browser can effectively display an HTML file, it is not easy to write an algorithm to give a short summary of the content of the webpage. You can certainly extract useful data from an HTML file, but you just saw that it takes a great deal of effort using a module such as **Beautiful Soup**. In fact, the name of the module describes the World Wide Web: it is a beautiful soup of unstructured data. Data scientists often spend a great deal of time finding their data. To read more, here's a great blog post on the topic: https://www.dataquest.io/blog/web-scraping-beautifulsoup/\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Semi-structured data:** You already have experience with semi-structured data: a *.csv* file is an example of semi-structured data. This is data that supports automated processing of its contents, such as we saw with Pandas during the our chapter on Open Data. In other courses, you may learn about [JSON](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_intro.asp), and in this notebook you will learn about [XML](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_whatis.asp). As you will soon see, the beauty of XML is that you can work with data in an automated way.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Structured data:** This is data that is stored in a *database*. Organizations such as corporations, governments, and universities will have servers dedicated to their databases and database software. The data stored in a database is similar to what you have seen in *.csv* files, but has some additional structure. We will not work with databases (structured data) in this class, but they are a great source of information. But if you want to learn more, you may want look up the term *relational database* or *SQL*.  "
